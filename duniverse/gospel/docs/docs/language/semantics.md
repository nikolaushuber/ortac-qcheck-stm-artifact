# Semantics

The Gospel paper[^1] describes how the semantics of the Gospel language is
defined by its translation to separation logic.

The `gospel` tool does only some type-checking of your Gospel-specified modules.
To exploit the semantics of your specifications, you'll have to use one of the
various [tools](../getting-started/tools).
