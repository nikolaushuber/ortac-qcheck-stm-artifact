# Standard Library

Gospel provides a set of useful types, functions and predicates that you can use
in your specifications. To get you started as quickly as possible, this standard
library tries to mimic conventions and naming that exist in the OCaml standard
library.

Please keep in mind that it only contains logical symbols though, and should not
be confused with those provided by the OCaml standard library (which you are not
allowed to use in specifications!).

The interface for the Gospel standard library can be seen
[here](pathname:///gospel/gospel/Gospelstdlib/index.html) or directly in the
[repository](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel/blob/main/src/stdlib/gospelstdlib.mli).
